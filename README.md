# Even And Multiple Of Five

### Complete the `checkNumber` function to check if a given number is both even and a multiple of 5 using logical operators. The function should take one argument, which is a number to be checked, and should return true if the input number is both even and a multiple of 5, and false otherwise. It should handle positive and negative integer input values, as well as zero as an input value. The function should use the logical AND operator (&&) to check whether the input number is even (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is zero) and also a multiple of 5 (i.e., its remainder when divided by 5 is zero). It should handle non-numeric input (e.g., a string) by returning false, and should not have any side effects on the input or any other variables outside the function.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The function should take one argument, which is a number to be checked.
- The function should return true if the input number is both even and a multiple of 5.
- The function should return false if the input number is not both even and a multiple of 5.
- The function should handle positive integer input values.
- The function should handle negative integer input values.
- The function should handle zero as an input value.
- The function should handle non-numeric input (e.g., a string) and return false.
